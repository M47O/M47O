<p>Hi! I'm Mason, and I have a passion for creating accessible, intuitive, and scalable hardware and software solutions. I enjoy building to augment and improve the day-to-day of my own life and find even greater joy when my work benefits others! I'm always open to contribute to projects, open-source or otherwise, that drive meaningful change. My tech stack includes TypeScript, Angular, React, Next.js, Node.js, Python, and a handful of BaaS and NoSQL DBs.</p>
